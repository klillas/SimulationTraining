# SimulationTraining

## Introduction
The intent of this repository is to see how much a simple 2d physics simulation can be optimized, and document the optimization steps.

## Projects
### Physics01
Physics01 contains a basic CPU-based 2d physics simulation with basic particle collision logic. It can handle a very low amount (50-100) of particles before the screen refresh rate is affected.
